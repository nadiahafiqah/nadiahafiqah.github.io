generate BMR

Men: BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) – (6.75 x age in years)
Women: BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 X weight in kilos) + (1.85 X height in cm) – (4.676 x age in years)

generate TDEE

Sedentary: little or no exercise (BMR x 1.2)
Light activity: light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week (BMR x 1.375)
Moderately active: moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week (BMR x 1.55)
Very active: hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week (BMR x 1.725)
Extra active: very hard daily exercise/sports & physical job or 2X day training (BMR x 1.9)

get input: GOAL (lose weight/maintain weight)
to lose -> reduce by avg of 500cals/week? **** to research ****
assuming a healthy weight loss of 0.5kg/week
assuming standard macro portions //// if time permits can include diff types of portions (eg. high protein, low carbs, etc.)

generate macros

1g protein = 4 cals (0.8g/lb of body weight)
1g fat = 9 cals (0.4g/lb of body weight)
1g carbs = 4 cals (remainder cals)

get input: food craving for the day

output: remaining macros for the day
recommend food items that can fit the remaining macros
