# Calorie Counter (with a local twist)

## What is this?

This calorie counter is made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. If you'd like to lose weight, but still want to enjoy your cheat meals, this is the calculator for you.

This is the first project in a series of projects completed in my journey in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course.

## How do I use it?

Simply key in the details required on the page and click "Calculate!". The calculator will generate your daily macronutrients and calories required for you if your goal is to lose weight.

You can then proceed to pick a cheat meal to see your remaining macronutrients and calories left for the day. That way, you can strategically plan your cheat meals every day based on the calculation given.

**_Every day is cheat day!_**
